# PasswordStrengthBackground
In this Project I have created a simple login form using tailwind css and added a  background image behind the login form by making its visibility blur. If the password is strong enough according to criteria then the background  image  wil get transitioned from blur to visible. Bluriness of  image is directly dependent on the password strength.
